            <h1>The Founding of Newport
</h1>
            <p>Newport Beach, California, was officially incorporated as a city in 1906, but its roots go back much further. The area first grew in the late 1800s when developers transformed the coastline into a small harbor town after a steamship successfully entered the bay in 1870, proving it was navigable. From those early days of fishing, shipping, and small-scale settlement, Newport quickly evolved into a thriving seaside community known for its harbor, beaches, and resort lifestyle.
